# boilerplabe-js-plain-browser-library

## What is this?
I did a boilerplate for writing boilerplate for npm library targetting browsers. 
This library is NOT including any UI framework (like React or Vue)

## Tech choices
  - babel + webpack for compiling
  - airbnb linter + prettier
  - husky + lint-staged
  - jest for unit tests
